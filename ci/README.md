# OpenCTEM Sensor CI/CD Templates

This directory contains CI/CD templates for integrating OpenCTEM security scanning into your pipelines.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Directory | Documentation |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| GitHub Actions | [github/](github/) | [GitHub README](github/README.md) |
| GitLab CI | [gitlab/](gitlab/) | [GitLab README](gitlab/README.md) |

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Actions | GitLab CI |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Reusable workflow | `openctem-security.yml` | `openctem-security.yml` |
| Parallel execution | `parallel-security.yml` | `parallel-security.yml` |
| Composite action | `action.yml` | N/A (uses extends) |
| Security dashboard | GitHub Security tab | GitLab Security Dashboard |
| SARIF support | Native | Native |

## CI identity: no stored API key (recommended)

The sensor can authenticate a CI job with the identity its CI provider gives
it (OIDC, api RFC-051) instead of an `API_KEY` secret:

1. In OpenCTEM, **Settings > Scanning > CI pipelines > Trust**: add the
   organizations or repositories whose pipelines may send results.
2. In the pipeline, set `API_URL` and `OPENCTEM_TENANT_ID` (your organization
   id) and let the job request an OIDC token:
   - GitHub Actions: `permissions: id-token: write` (the templates here pass
     `tenant_id` through);
   - GitLab CI: the templates define `id_tokens: OPENCTEM_ID_TOKEN` with the
     audience `openctem:tenant:$OPENCTEM_TENANT_ID`.

The sensor exchanges the job's token at the first upload for a run token that
lives at most 15 minutes and is bound to the job's repository, uploads the
results, asks the platform's gate for the verdict, prints the blocking
findings and links, and exits 1 when the verdict is `fail`. `FAIL_ON` then only
decides when the platform cannot be reached. No token is ever printed. Fork
pull requests get no token unless the trust configuration admits them.

`API_KEY` keeps working but is deprecated for CI: the sensor prints a warning.

## Common Configuration

Both platforms support these configuration variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PUSH` | `"true"` | Push results to OpenCTEM platform |
| `COMMENTS` | `"true"` | Post findings as PR/MR comments |
| `FAIL_ON` | `"critical"` | Security gate threshold |
| `VERBOSE` | `"false"` | Enable verbose output |

### Smart Defaults

- If `PUSH` is enabled but neither `OPENCTEM_TENANT_ID` (CI identity) nor `API_KEY` is set, push is automatically disabled
- This allows testing CI integration without platform credentials (scan-only mode)

## Security Gate

The `FAIL_ON` variable controls when the pipeline should fail:

| Value | Blocks on |
|-------|-----------|
| `critical` | Critical findings only |
| `high` | High and Critical |
| `medium` | Medium, High, and Critical |
| `low` | All findings |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Pass - no findings above threshold |
| 1 | Fail - findings above threshold |
| 2 | Error - configuration or runtime error |

## Tool Update Mechanism

| Tool | Update Method | Frequency |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Semgrep | Rules fetched from Registry | Every scan |
| Trivy | DB auto-downloads | Every 6 hours |
| Betterleaks | Rules embedded in binary | On image update |
| Nuclei | Templates auto-update | On first run |
